# ESP32 CYD Ticker Display ðŸ“ˆ
An ESP-32 based stock ticker display, inspired by [TickrMeter](https://tickrmeter.com/). Since I had one spare I decided to use the [CYD ESP-32 board](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display). However in the future I may switch to an e-Ink display instead. Currently uses the `finnhub.io` market api since its free plan allows for 60 api calls per minute. There is still ***A LOT*** of polishing and features that need to be added. However it is functional *despite the unoptimised prototype code.*

## âš¡ Flashing ESP-32 CYD
Get the latest `firmware.bin` file [from here](https://github.com/reckedpr/esp-ticker/releases/latest)

Then flash the esp32 cyd either:

- ### Using [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases/latest)
- ### OR, Using [esp web tool](https://esp.huhn.me/)

## âš  If building from source
#### The `User_Setup.h` file for `TFT_eSPI` needs to be configured for the correct TFT display! 

ðŸ‘‡ A working configuration for the cyd can be found here:

[RuiSantosdotme/ESP32-TFT-Touchscreen/configs/User_Setup.h](https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme/ESP32-TFT-Touchscreen/blob/main/configs/User_Setup.h)

- Copy the contents or download the file
- Navigate to `<project folder>/.pio/libdeps/TFT_eSPI`
- Replace the contents of, or the whole file, `User_Setup.h`

#### Then Ensure that you add these lines to `User_Setup.h`
```c
#define TFT_RGB_ORDER TFT_BGR
#define TFT_INVERSION_ON
```


*If you are using arduino IDE, then you need to head to* `<*>/Arduino/libraries/TFT_eSPI`

\* Arduino Sketchbook folder location. This can be found at  `File > Preferences > Sketchbook location`
